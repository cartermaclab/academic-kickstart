Raj joined the lab in 2019 after completing his undergraduate degree at McMaster University. During his undergraduate studies, he completed his 4th-year thesis with Dr. Stuart Phillips. His MSc work uses EEG to investigate the processes contributing to sensorimotor adaptation. He is currently funded by an NSERC CGS-M scholarship. 

Fun fact: Raj also volunteers his time by coaching a youth hockey team. Some say his coaching style mirrors that of John Tortorella.
