Mirette joined the lab in 2019 after completing her undergraduate studies at McMaster University. During her undergraduate studies, she completed her 4th-year thesis with Dr. Stuart Phillips. Her MSc work focuses on physiological and social-cognitive explanations for the Gunslinger Effect. She is currently funded by an Ontario Graduate Scholarship.

Fun fact: She has been known to confuse spiders with bees.
