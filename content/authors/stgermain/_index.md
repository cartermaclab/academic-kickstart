Laura joined the lab in September 2018 after completing her undergraduate and MSc at the University of Ottawa. Her MSc work was conducted with Dr. Diane Ste-Marie and examined self-controlled observational learning. Her PhD work focuses on motor interactions during learning and her work is currently funded by an NSERC PGS-D scholarship. 

Fun fact: Laura is also the proud owner of the least cute dog in the lab.
