My students and I study how humans plan, control, and learn skilled actions. Our lab is particularly interested in how errors influence decision-making and strategy use to shape learning. We are also interested in looking at the field of kinesiology through a metascience lens. We are committed to open sciences practices in an effort to promote reproducibility and replicability. 

Our work will advance fundamental knowledge in the area of motor neuroscience and will yield evidence-based recommendations for training protocols in rehabilitation, sport, and vocational settings.

The lab is located in the [Department of Kinesiology](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/kinesiology/) (Ivor Wynne Centre) within the [Faculty of Science](https://www.science.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/).
