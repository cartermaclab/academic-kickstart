When we wish to learn something new we often have to take charge of our own training protocol. Learning a new musical instrument like the guitar involves learning multiple component tasks such as unique hand postures for different notes and chords. When learning alone, we must decide how to invest in learning all task variations. Although some work has examined this question, these studies have held the amount of training constant across each task. However, in our daily lives we do not always allocate an equal amount of time to each task we are trying to learn. Instead, we must make purposeful decisions about how to invest our time (e.g., whether to exploit known skills or explore less-known ones) to maximize overall proficiency. We are interested in the factors that affect our training choices and whether these decisions are optimal when the amount of training per skill can vary.
