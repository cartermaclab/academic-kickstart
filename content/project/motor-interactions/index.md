Motor interactions between multiple agents is common in everyday life. In recent years, the prevalence of assistive robots has increased in a variety of rehabilitative and training settings (e.g., surgery) where the human and robot collaborate to achieve a common goal. During such collaborative interactions, the human user must plan and execute their actions in relations to what they anticipate the robotic device will do. We are interested in determining how humans interact with robots when they each have some independent control over the same control point.
