The underlying cause of errors in skilled actions is often ambiguous and difficult to assign. This assignment difficulty result from having to rely on noisy (i.e., uncertain) and delayed sensory information. Feedback from an external source (e.g., therapist, teacher, coach) can aid assignment processes. It is well established that allowing learners to decide when they receive such feedback, termed self-controlled feedback schedules, is more effective for learning than externally-imposed (i.e., yoked) feedback schedules. Yet, the mechanisms that underlie this robust learning advantage are not fully understood, with researchers adopting either a motivational or an information-processing explanation. We are currently testing between these explanations, with our work highlighting a greater role of information-processing factors over motivational influences.
