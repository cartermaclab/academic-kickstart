Our lab is always seeking self-motivated, creative, and curious people to enhance our research group. The lab has a strong commitment to the training and development of all its team members by promoting a highly collaborative research environment and fostering a passion for lifelong learning and discovery. We are committed to supporting and promoting diversity and equity in our lab. Everyone, regardless of race, nationality, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, or religion, is welcome in our lab.

## Graduate student opportunities
The study of movement neuroscience is multidisciplinary so students with backgrounds in the areas of, but not limited to, kinesiology, neuroscience, psychology, engineering, or mathematics are encouraged to apply. Students interested in working towards graduate degrees at the M.Sc. and Ph.D. levels are encouraged to consult the information pertaining to graduate studies in the Department of Kinesiology and the School of Graduate of Studies.

## Undergraduate student opportunities
Undergraduates will have the opportunity to work in the lab as part of their undergraduate degree requirements (e.g., honour's thesis) or to explore an interest in sensorimotor control and learning by gaining some research experience (e.g., student volunteer). You will have the opportunity to get involved in all stages of the research process, with the goal of conducting your own research and disseminating your findings at an academic conference and in a peer-reviewed journal. This is typically a volunteer position; however, there is the possibility of paid positions depending on your experience and the availability of funds if you are interested in working the lab during the summer.


**If you are interested in joining the lab, please contact Dr. Carter by email and include your CV, your unofficial academic transcript, and a statement of research interests (max 1-page).**
